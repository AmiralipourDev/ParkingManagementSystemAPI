# ParkingManagementSystemAPI

---

#### Hello. This is a **Django rest framework (DRF)** project for a parking management system, which is a simulation of a parking system where the user can make his reservation on the day and time he wants.

---

##### First of all, to use this project, you must have the required Python packages. For this purpose, enter the following code in the terminal:

``` py
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

##### On the first page, we have the api root that you can see in the picture and the links that each redirect to a link.

---

##### On this page, you can see the spaces where it is possible to park a car. Of course, the space may be full. (`"is_occupied: true"`)

##### On this page, you can see the reservations that have already been booked along with their reservation time.

##### In the last picture we have called Reservation Instance, you can see a pre-reserved item and you can update(put), patch or delete it.
